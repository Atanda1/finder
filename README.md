University students here have issues finding their properties once it goes missing, especially when it’s in public places like the library, classroom etc. For exampe, David on our team once misplaced his watch and only found out after two days. Even if someone found it and wanted to return it, there was no way they could meet.
This app helps to “reunite” lost items to their owners in record time. How it works is very straight forward:
An individual(finder) finds an item that’s lost
 Posts it on the our platform as part of the lost items
A claimer(looking for his/her lost property) goes on the site and looks for the property.
If it’s there, the claimer fills the claim form without knowing the finder.
The finder receives the notification along with the phone number of the claimer and can contact the claimer if the form information matches that of the lost item.
